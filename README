I. Adding the eiger824 layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the eiger824 layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the eiger824 layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the eiger824 layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-eiger824 \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer adds some custom scripts that I usually like to have in my distros.

III. Other Changes
==================

Since I use systemd, I don't want to support compatibility with SysV and hence
I had to comment out a post-installation function in meta/recipes-core/systemd/systemd-compat-units.bb
which caused some services to be masked.
